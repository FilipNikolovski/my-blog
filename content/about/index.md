Hello there! I'm a software engineer in Skopje, Macedonia with a passion for computers, programming and designing and developing distributed systems. I have 6 years of experience as a backend engineer with a focus on distributed systems, designing APIs and microservices.

Currently I'm working at [InPlayer](https://inplayer.com) as Lead of R&D, where my responsibilities include managing and leading the development and operations team, researching and integrating new technologies within our product and involved with designing and programming the backend of the platform.

In my free time, I love working on open-source software, programming in Go as well as dabbling with the latest tools and technologies, and testing new stuff out on my pet projects.
I am also a huge sci-fi geek and an avid reader.
